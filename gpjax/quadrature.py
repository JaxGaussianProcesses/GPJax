    r"""Compute Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

    Compute Gaussian-Hermite quadrature for a given function. The quadrature
    points are adjusted through the supplied mean and variance arrays.

    Args:
        fun (Callable): The function for which quadrature should be applied to.
        mean (Float[Array, "N D"]): The mean of the Gaussian distribution that
            is used to shift quadrature points.
        sd (Float[Array, "N D"]): The standard deviation of the Gaussian
            distribution that is used to scale quadrature points.
        deg (int, optional): The number of quadrature points that are to be used.
            Defaults to 20.

    Returns
    -------
        Float[Array, " N"]: The evaluated integrals value.
