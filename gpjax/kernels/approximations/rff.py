    All stationary kernels are equivalent to the Fourier transform of a probability
    distribution. We call the corresponding distribution the spectral density. Using
    a finite number of basis functions, we can compute the spectral density using a
    Monte-Carlo approximation. This is done by sampling from the spectral density and
    computing the Fourier transform of the samples. The kernel is then approximated by
    the inner product of the Fourier transform of the samples with the Fourier
    transform of the data.

    The key reference for this implementation is the following papers:
    - 'Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines' by Rahimi and Recht (2008).
    - 'On the Error of Random Fourier Features' by Sutherland and Schneider (2015).
