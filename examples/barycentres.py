# # Gaussian Processes Barycentres
#
# In this notebook we'll give an implementation of
# <strong data-cite="mallasto2017learning"></strong>. In this work, the existence of a
# Wasserstein barycentre between a collection of Gaussian processes is proven. When
# faced with trying to _average_ a set of probability distributions, the Wasserstein
# barycentre is an attractive choice as it enables uncertainty amongst the individual
# distributions to be incorporated into the averaged distribution. When compared to a
# naive _mean of means_ and _mean of variances_ approach to computing the average
# probability distributions, it can be seen that Wasserstein barycentres offer
# significantly more favourable uncertainty estimation.

# ## Background
#
# ### Wasserstein distance
#
# The 2-Wasserstein distance metric between two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
# quantifies the minimal cost required to transport the unit mass from $\mu$ to $\nu$,
# or vice-versa. Typically, computing this metric requires solving a linear program.
# However, when $\mu$ and $\nu$ both belong to the family of multivariate Gaussian
# distributions, the solution is analytically given by
#
# $$
# W_2^2(\mu, \nu) = \lVert m_1- m_2 \rVert^2_2 + \operatorname{Tr}(S_1 + S_2 - 2(S_1^{1/2}S_2S_1^{1/2})^{1/2}),
# $$
#
# where $\mu \sim \mathcal{N}(m_1, S_1)$ and $\nu\sim\mathcal{N}(m_2, S_2)$.
#
# ### Wasserstein barycentre
#
# For a collection of $T$ measures
# $\lbrace\mu_i\rbrace_{t=1}^T \in \mathcal{P}_2(\theta)$, the Wasserstein barycentre
# $\bar{\mu}$ is the measure that minimises the average Wasserstein distance to all
# other measures in the set. More formally, the Wasserstein barycentre is the Fr√©chet
# mean on a Wasserstein space that we can write as
#
# $$
# \bar{\mu} = \operatorname{argmin}_{\mu\in\mathcal{P}_2(\theta)}\sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t W_2^2(\mu, \mu_t),
# $$
#
# where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^T$ is a weight vector that sums to 1.
#
# As with the Wasserstein distance, identifying the Wasserstein barycentre $\bar{\mu}$
# is often an computationally demanding optimisation problem. However, when all the
# measures admit a multivariate Gaussian density, the barycentre
# $\bar{\mu} = \mathcal{N}(\bar{m}, \bar{S})$ has analytical solutions
#
# $$
# \bar{m} = \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t m_t\,, \quad \bar{S}=\sum_{t=1}^T\alpha_t (\bar{S}^{1/2}S_t\bar{S}^{1/2})^{1/2}\,. \qquad (\star)
# $$
#
# Identifying $\bar{S}$ is achieved through a fixed-point iterative update.
#
# ## Barycentre of Gaussian processes
#
# It was shown in <strong data-cite="mallasto2017learning"></strong> that the
# barycentre $\bar{f}$ of a collection of Gaussian processes
# $\lbrace f_i\rbrace_{i=1}^T$ such that $f_i \sim \mathcal{GP}(m_i, K_i)$ can be
# found using the same solutions as in $(\star)$. For a full theoretical understanding,
# we recommend reading the original paper. However, the central argument to this result
# is that one can first show that the barycentre GP
# $\bar{f}\sim\mathcal{GP}(\bar{m}, \bar{S})$ is non-degenerate for any finite set of
# GPs $\lbrace f_t\rbrace_{t=1}^T$ i.e., $T<\infty$. With this established, one can
# show that for a $n$-dimensional finite Gaussian distribution $f_{i,n}$, the
# Wasserstein metric between any two Gaussian distributions $f_{i, n}, f_{j, n}$
# converges to the Wasserstein metric between GPs as $n\to\infty$.
#
# In this notebook, we will demonstrate how this can be achieved in GPJax.
#
# ## Dataset
#
# We'll simulate five datasets and develop a Gaussian process posterior before
# identifying the Gaussian process barycentre at a set of test points. Each dataset
# will be a sine function with a different vertical shift, periodicity, and quantity
# of noise.

# [TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/substrates/jax)
# distribution, making it
# straightforward to extract the mean vector and covariance matrix of each GP for
# learning a barycentre. We implement the fixed point scheme given in (3) in the
# following cell by utilising Jax's `vmap` operator to speed up large matrix operations
# using broadcasting in `tensordot`.

# ## Displacement interpolation
#
# In the above example, we assigned uniform weights to each of the posteriors within
# the barycentre. In practice, we may have prior knowledge of which posterior is most
# likely to be the correct one. Regardless of the weights chosen, the barycentre
# remains a Gaussian process. We can interpolate between a pair of posterior
# distributions $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ to visualise the corresponding barycentre
# $\bar{\mu}$.
