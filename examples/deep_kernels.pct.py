# # Deep Kernel Learning
#
# In this notebook we demonstrate how GPJax can be used in conjunction with
# [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku) to build deep kernel Gaussian
# processes. Modelling data with discontinuities is a challenging task for regular
# Gaussian process models. However, as shown in
# <strong data-cite="wilson2016deep"></strong>, transforming the inputs to our
# Gaussian process model's kernel through a neural network can offer a solution to this.

# ## Deep kernels
#
# ### Details
#
# Instead of applying a kernel $k(\cdot, \cdot')$ directly on some data, we seek to
# apply a _feature map_ $\phi(\cdot)$ that projects the data to learn more meaningful
# representations beforehand. In deep kernel learning, $\phi$ is a neural network
# whose parameters are learned jointly with the GP model's hyperparameters. The
# corresponding kernel is then computed by $k(\phi(\cdot), \phi(\cdot'))$. Here
# $k(\cdot,\cdot')$ is referred to as the _base kernel_.
#
# ### Implementation
#
# Although deep kernels are not currently supported natively in GPJax, defining one is
# straightforward as we now demonstrate. Inheriting from the base `AbstractKernel`
# in GPJax, we create the `DeepKernelFunction` object that allows the
# user to supply the neural network and base kernel of their choice. Kernel matrices
# are then computed using the regular `gram` and `cross_covariance` functions.

# ### Defining a network
#
# With a deep kernel object created, we proceed to define a neural network. Here we
# consider a small multi-layer perceptron with two linear hidden layers and ReLU
# activation functions between the layers. The first hidden layer contains 64 units,
# while the second layer contains 32 units. Finally, we'll make the output of our
# network a three units wide. The corresponding kernel that we define will then be of
# [ARD form](https://gpjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbs/kernels.html#Active-dimensions)
# to allow for different lengthscales in each dimension of the feature space.
# Users may wish to design more intricate network structures for more complex tasks,
# which functionality is supported well in Haiku.

#
# Having characterised the feature extraction network, we move to define a Gaussian
# process parameterised by this deep kernel. We consider a third-order Mat√©rn base
# kernel and assume a Gaussian likelihood.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Optimisation
#
# We train our model via maximum likelihood estimation of the marginal log-likelihood.
# The parameters of our neural network are learned jointly with the model's
# hyperparameter set.
#
# With the inclusion of a neural network, we take this opportunity to highlight the
# additional benefits gleaned from using
# [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for optimisation. In particular, we
# showcase the ability to use a learning rate scheduler that decays the optimiser's
# learning rate throughout the inference. We decrease the learning rate according to a
# half-cosine curve over 700 iterations, providing us with large step sizes early in
# the optimisation procedure before approaching more conservative values, ensuring we
# do not step too far. We also consider a linear warmup, where the learning rate is
# increased from 0 to 1 over 50 steps to get a reasonable initial learning rate value.
