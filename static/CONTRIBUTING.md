# Guidelines for Contributing

GPJax welcomes contributions from interested individuals or groups. These
guidelines help explain how you can contribute to the library

There are 4 main ways of contributing to the library (in descending order of
difficulty or scope):

- Adding new or improved functionality to the existing codebase
- Fixing outstanding issues (bugs) with the existing codebase. They range from
  low-level software bugs to higher-level design problems.
- Contributing or improving the documentation (`docs`) or examples
  (`gpjax/docs/nbs`)
- Submitting issues related to bugs or desired enhancements

## Code of conduct

As a contributor to GPJax, you can help us keep the community open and
inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Opening issues and getting support

Please open issues on [Github Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax/issues/new/choose).

You can ask a question or start a discussion in the [Discussion
section](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax/discussions) on Github.

# Contributing code via pull requests

Please submit patches via pull requests.

The preferred workflow for contributing is to fork the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax), clone it to your local
machine, and develop on a feature branch. Once you are ready to commit your
changes, install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install` and the commit
and push your code as usual.

## Steps:

1. Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax) by
   clicking on the 'Fork' button near the top right of the main repository page.
   This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.

2. Clone your fork of the GPJax repo from your GitHub account to your local
   disk, and add the base repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub handle>/GPJax.git
   $ cd GPJax
   $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:GPJax.git
   ```

3. Create a `feature` branch to hold your development changes:

   ```bash
   $ git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

   Always use a `feature` branch. It's good practice to never routinely work on
   the `master` branch of any repository.

4. Project requirements are in `requirements.txt`.

   We suggest using a [virtual
   environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) for development.
   Once the virtual environment is activated, run:

   ```bash
   $ pip install -e .
   $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. Install the pre-commit hooks. Please **ensure you do this before committing
   any files**. This can be done by executing the following:
   ```bash
   $ pre-commit install
   ```
   If successful, this will print the following output `pre-commit installed at
   .git/hooks/pre-commit`.

6. Develop the feature on your feature branch.  When you're done editing, format the new code with
   ```bash
   $ poetry run pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure
   ```
   If any errors are reported, fix them and re-run the command.

7. Check all tests are passing
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest tests --n auto
   ```
   If any tests fail, fix them and re-run the command.

8. Add changed files using `git add` and then `git commit` files:

   ```bash
   $ git add modified_files
   $ git commit
   ```

   to record your changes locally. After committing, it is a good idea to sync
   with the base repository in case there have been any changes:

   ```bash
   $ git fetch upstream
   $ git rebase upstream/main
   ```

   Then push the changes to your GitHub account with:

   ```bash
   $ git push -u origin my-feature
   ```

9.  Go to the GitHub web page of your fork of the GPJax repo. Click the 'Pull
   request' button to send your changes to the project's maintainer for review.

## Pull request checklist

We recommended that your contribution complies with the following guidelines
before you submit a pull request:

- If your pull request addresses an issue, please use the pull request title to
  describe the issue and mention the issue number in the pull request
  description. This will make sure a link back to the original issue is created.

- All public methods must have informative docstrings

- Please prefix the title of incomplete contributions with `[WIP]` (to indicate
  a work in progress). WIPs may be useful to (1) indicate you are working on
  something to avoid duplicated work, (2) request broad review of functionality
  or API, or (3) seek collaborators.

- All other tests pass when everything is rebuilt from scratch.

- Documentation and high-coverage tests are necessary for enhancements to be
  accepted.

- Code with good test, check with:

  ```bash
  $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
  $ pytest tests --cov=./ --cov-report=html
  ```
