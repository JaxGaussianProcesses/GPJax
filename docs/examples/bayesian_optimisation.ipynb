    "\n",
    "Countless problems in the physical world involve optimising functions for which the\n",

    "their domain. For example, within the domain of science the task of designing new\n",
    "molecules with optimised properties ([Griffiths and Lobato,\n",
    "2020](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/sc/c9sc04026a)) is incredibly\n",
    "useful. Here, the domain being optimised over is the space of possible molecules, with\n",
    "the objective function depending on the property being optimised, for instance within\n",
    "drug-design this may be the efficacy of the drug. The function from molecules to\n",
    "efficacy is unknown, but can be queried by synthesising a molecule and running an\n",
    "experiment to measure its efficacy. This is clearly an expensive procedure!\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the domain of machine learning, the task of optimising neural network\n",
    "architectures is another example of such a problem (commonly referred to as [Neural\n",
    "Architecture Search (NAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_architecture_search)).\n",
    "Here, the domain is the space of possible neural network architectures, and the\n",
    "objective function is a metric such as the accuracy of the trained model. Again, the\n",
    "function from neural network architectures to accuracy is unknown, but can be queried by\n",
    "training a model with a given architecture and evaluating its accuracy. This is also an\n",
    "expensive procedure, as training models can be incredibly time consuming and\n",
    "computationally demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these problems are ubiquitous within the field of climate science, with\n",
    "([Hellan et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04343)) providing several excellent\n",
    "examples. One such example is the task of deciding where to place wind turbines in a\n",
    "wind farm in order to maximise the energy generated. Here, the domain is the space of\n",
    "possible locations for the wind turbines, and the objective function is the energy\n",

    "## What is Bayesian Optimisation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimisation (BO) ([Močkus, 1974](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-07165-2_55)) provides a principled\n",
    "method for making decisions under uncertainty. The aim of BO is to find the global\n",
    "minimum of a *black-box* objective function, $\\min_{\\mathbf{x} \\in X}\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{x})$. The function $f$ is said to be a *black-box* function because its\n",
    "explicit functional form is unknown. However, it is assumed that one is able to\n",
    "ascertain information about the function by evaluating it at points in its domain,\n",
    "$X$. However, these evaluations are assumed to be *expensive*, as seen in the\n",
    "motivating examples. Therefore, the goal of BO is to minimise $f$ with as few\n",
    "evaluations of the black-box function as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, BO can be thought of as *sequential decision-making* problem. At each iteration\n",
    "one must choose which point (or batch of points) in a function's domain to evaluate\n",
    "next, drawing on previously observed values to make optimal decisions. In order to do\n",
    "this effectively, we need a way of representing our uncertainty about the black-box\n",
    "function $f$, which we can update in light of observing more data. Gaussian processes\n",
    "will be an ideal tool for this purpose!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Surrogate models* lie at the heart of BO, and are used to model the black-box\n",
    "function. GPs are a natural choice for this model, as they not only provide point\n",
    "estimates for the values taken by the function throughout its domain, but crucially\n",
    "provide a full predictive posterior *distribution* of the range of values the function\n",
    "may take. This rich quantification of uncertainty enables BO to balance *exploration*\n",
    "and *exploitation* in order to efficiently converge upon minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having chosen a surrogate model, which we can use to express our current beliefs about\n",
    "the black-box function, ideally we would like a method which can use the surrogate\n",
    "model's posterior distribution to automatically decide which point(s) in the black-box\n",
    "function's domain to query next. This is where *acquisition functions* come in. The\n",
    "acquisition function $\\alpha: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined over the same domain as the\n",
    "surrogate model, and uses the surrogate model's posterior distribution to quantify the\n",
    "expected *utility*, $U$, of evaluating the black-box function at a given point. Simply\n",
    "put, for each point in the black-box function's domain, $\\mathbf{x} \\in X$, the\n",
    "acquisition function quantifies how useful it would be to evaluate the black-box\n",
    "function at $\\mathbf{x}$ in order to find the minimum of the black-box function, whilst\n",
    "taking into consideration all the datapoints observed so far. Therefore, in order to\n",
    "decide which point to query next we simply choose the point which maximises the\n",
    "acquisition function, using an optimiser such as L-BFGS ([Liu and Nocedal,\n",
    "1989](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01589116)).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Select the next point to query, $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$, by maximising the acquisition function $\\alpha$, defined using the surrogate model $\\mathcal{M}_i$ conditioned on previously observed data $\\mathcal{D}_i$:\n",

    "3. Append the most recent observation to the dataset, $\\mathcal{D}_{i+1} = \\mathcal{D}_i\n",
    "   \\cup \\{(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Condition the model on the updated dataset to yield $\\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, such as a function\n",
