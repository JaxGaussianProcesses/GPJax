    "Using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model functions can offer several advantages over alternative methods, such as deep neural networks. One key advantage is their rich quantification of uncertainty; not only do they provide *point estimates* for the values taken by a function throughout its domain, but they provide a full predictive posterior *distribution* over the range of values the function may take. This rich quantification of uncertainty is useful in many applications, such as Bayesian optimisation, which relies on being able to make *uncertainty-aware* decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, another advantage of GPs is the ability for one to place *priors* on the functions being modelled. For instance, one may know that the underlying function being modelled observes certain characteristics, such as being *periodic* or having a certain level of *smoothness*. The *kernel*, or *covariance function*, is the primary means through which one is able to encode such prior knowledge about the function being modelled. This enables one to equip the GP with inductive biases which enable it to learn from data more efficiently, whilst generalising to unseen data more effectively.\n",

    "## What is a Kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, for a function $f$, the kernel defines the notion of *similarity* between\n",
    "the value of the function at two points, $f(\\mathbf{x})$ and $f(\\mathbf{x}')$, and\n",
    "will be denoted as $k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}')$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}') &= \\text{Cov}[f(\\mathbf{x}),\n",
    "f(\\mathbf{x}')] \\\\ &= \\mathbb{E}[(f(\\mathbf{x}) - \\mathbb{E}[f(\\mathbf{x})])(f(\\mathbf{x}') - \\mathbb{E}[f(\\mathbf{x}')])] \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    " One would expect that, given a previously unobserved test point $\\mathbf{x}^*$, the\n",
    " training points which are *closest* to this unobserved point will be most similar to\n",
    " it. As such, the kernel is used to define this notion of similarity within the GP\n",
    " framework. It is up to the user to select a kernel function which is appropriate for\n",
    " the function being modelled. In this notebook we are going to give some examples of\n",
    " commonly used kernels, and try to develop an understanding of when one may wish to use\n",
    " one kernel over another. However, before we do this, it is worth discussing the\n",
    " necessary conditions for a function to be a valid kernel/covariance function. This\n",
    " requires a little bit of maths, so for those of you who just wish to obtain an\n",
    " intuitive understanding, feel free to skip to the section introducing the Matérn\n",
    " family of kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the necessary conditions for a function to be a valid kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst intuitively the kernel function is used to define the notion of similarity within\n",
    "the GP framework, it is important to note that there are two *necessary conditions*\n",
    "that a kernel function must satisfy in order to be a valid covariance function. For\n",
    "clarity, we will refer to *any* function mapping two inputs to a scalar output as a\n",
    "*kernel function*, and we will refer to a *valid* kernel function satisfying the two\n",
    "necessary conditions as a *covariance function*. However, it is worth noting that the\n",
    "GP community often uses the terms *kernel function* and *covariance function*\n",
    "interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first necessary condition is that the covariance function must be *symmetric*, i.e.\n",
    "$k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}') = k(\\mathbf{x}', \\mathbf{x})$. This is because the\n",
    "covariance between two random variables $X$ and $X'$ is symmetric; if one looks at the\n",
    "definition of covariance given above, it is clear that it is invariant to swapping the\n",
    "order of the inputs $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{x}'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second necessary condition is that the covariance function must be *positive\n",
    "semi-definite* (PSD). In order to understand this condition, it is useful to first\n",
    "introduce the concept of a *Gram matrix*. We'll use the same notation as the [GP introduction\n",
    "notebook](https://docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com/examples/intro_to_gps/), and denote\n",
    "$n$ input points as $\\mathbf{X} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_1, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_n\\}$. Given these\n",
    "input points and a kernel function $k$ the *Gram matrix* stores the pairwise kernel\n",
    "evaluations between all input points. Mathematically, this leads to the Gram matrix being defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{X}) = \\begin{bmatrix} k(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_1) & \\cdots & k(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_n) \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ k(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{x}_1) & \\cdots & k(\\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{x}_n) \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "such that $K(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{X})_{ij} = k(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for $k$ to be a valid covariance function, the corresponding Gram matrix\n",
    "must be *positive semi-definite*. In this case the Gram matrix is referred to as a\n",
    "*covariance matrix*. A real $n \\times n$ matrix $K$ is positive semi-definite if and\n",
    "only if for all vectors $\\mathbf{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{z}^\\top K \\mathbf{z} \\geq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, a real $n \\times n$ matrix $K$ is positive semi-definite if and only if\n",
    "all of its eigenvalues are non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the two necessary conditions for a function to be a valid covariance function\n",
    "are that it must be *symmetric* and *positive semi-definite*. In this section we have\n",
    "referred to *any* function from two inputs to a scalar output as a *kernel function*,\n",
    "with its corresponding matrix of pairwise evaluations referred to as the *Gram matrix*,\n",
    "and a function satisfying the two necessary conditions as a *covariance function*, with\n",
    "its corresponding matrix of pairwise evaluations referred to as the *covariance matrix*.\n",
    "This enabled us to easily define the necessary conditions for a function to be a valid\n",
    "covariance function. However, as noted previously, the GP community often uses these\n",
    "terms interchangeably, and so we will for the remainder of this notebook.\n"

    "The plots above clearly show that the choice of $\\nu$ has a large impact on the *smoothness* of the functions being modelled by the GP, with functions drawn from GPs defined with the Matérn kernel becoming increasingly smooth as $\\nu \\to \\infty$. More formally, this notion of smoothness is captured through the mean-square differentiability of the function being modelled. Functions sampled from GPs using a Matérn kernel are $k$-times mean-square differentiable, if and only if $\\nu > k$. For instance, functions sampled from a GP using a Matérn12 kernel are zero times mean-square differentiable, and functions sampled from a GP using the RBF kernel are infinitely mean-square differentiable.\n",

This is a useful property to have, as it means that the kernel is invariant to translations in the input space. They also go beyond this, as they only depend on the Euclidean *distance* between the two points being compared, $|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}'|$. Kernels which satisfy this property are known as *isotropic* kernels. This makes the function invariant to all rigid motions in the input space, such as rotations."

Whilst this is beyond the scope of this notebook, feel free to checkout out our [notebook on graph kernels](https://docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com/examples/graph_kernels/) for an introduction on how to define the Matérn kernel on graph-structured data, and there are a wide variety of resources online for learning about defining kernels in other domains. In terms of open-source libraries, the [Geometric Kernels](https://github.com/GPflow/GeometricKernels) library could be a good place to start if you're interested in looking at how these kernels may be implemented, with the additional benefit that it is compatible with GPJax."

    "Congratulations on making it this far! We hope that this guide has given you a good introduction to kernels and how they can be used in GPJax. If you're interested in learning more about kernels, we recommend the following resources, which have also been used as inspiration for this guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf) - Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive overview of kernels, diving deep into some of the technical details and also providing some kernels defined on non-Euclidean spaces such as strings.\n",
    "- David Duvenaud's [Kernel Cookbook](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/) is a great resource for learning about kernels, and also provides some information about some of the pitfalls people commonly encounter when using the Matérn family of kernels. His PhD thesis, [Automatic Model Construction with Gaussian Processes](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/thesis.pdf), also provides some in-depth recipes for how one may incorporate their prior knowledge when constructing kernels.\n",
    "- Finally, please check out our [more advanced kernel guide](https://docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com/examples/constructing_new_kernels/), which details some more kernels available in GPJax as well as how one may combine kernels together to form more complex kernels.\n",
