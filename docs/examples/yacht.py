# # UCI Data Benchmarking
#
# In this notebook, we will show how to apply GPJax on a benchmark UCI regression
# problem. These kind of tasks are often used in the research community to benchmark
# and assess new techniques against those already in the literature. Much of the code
# contained in this notebook can be adapted to applied problems concerning datasets
# other than the one presented here.

# ## Data Loading
#
# We'll be using the
# [Yacht](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yacht+hydrodynamics) dataset from
# the UCI machine learning data repository. Each observation describes the
# hydrodynamic performance of a yacht through its resistance. The dataset contains 6
# covariates and a single positive, real valued response variable. There are 308
# observations in the dataset, so we can comfortably use a conjugate regression
# Gaussian process here (for more more details, checkout the
# [Regression notebook](https://docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com/examples/regression/)).

# %%
try:
    yacht = pd.read_fwf("data/yacht_hydrodynamics.data", header=None).values[:-1, :]
except FileNotFoundError:
    yacht = pd.read_fwf(
        "docs/examples/data/yacht_hydrodynamics.data", header=None
    ).values[:-1, :]

X = yacht[:, :-1]
y = yacht[:, -1].reshape(-1, 1)

# ## Preprocessing
#
# With a dataset loaded, we'll now preprocess it such that it is more amenable to
# modelling with a Gaussian process.
#
# ### Data Partitioning
#
# We'll first partition our data into a _training_ and _testing_ split. We'll fit our
# Gaussian process to the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.
# This allows us to investigate how effectively our Gaussian process generalises to
# out-of-sample datapoints and ensure that we are not overfitting. We'll hold 30% of
# our data back for testing purposes.

# %%
Xtr, Xte, ytr, yte = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Response Variable
#
# We'll now process our response variable $\mathbf{y}$. As the below plots show, the
# data has a very long tail and is certainly not Gaussian. However, we would like to
# model a Gaussian response variable so that we can adopt a Gaussian likelihood
# function and leverage the model's conjugacy. To achieve this, we'll first log-scale
# the data, to bring the long right tail in closer to the data's mean. We'll then
# standardise the data such that is distributed according to a unit normal
# distribution. Both of these transformations are invertible through the log-normal
# expectation and variance formulae and the the inverse standardisation identity,
# should we ever need our model's predictions to be back on the scale of the
# original dataset.
#
# For transforming both the input and response variable, all transformations will be
# done with respect to the training data where relevant.

# %%
log_ytr = np.log(ytr)
log_yte = np.log(yte)

y_scaler = StandardScaler().fit(log_ytr)
scaled_ytr = y_scaler.transform(log_ytr)
scaled_yte = y_scaler.transform(log_yte)

# %% [markdown]
# We can see the effect of these transformations in the below three panels.

# %%
fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(9, 2.5))
ax[0].hist(ytr, bins=30, color=cols[1])
ax[0].set_title("y")
ax[1].hist(log_ytr, bins=30, color=cols[1])
ax[1].set_title("log(y)")
ax[2].hist(scaled_ytr, bins=30, color=cols[1])
ax[2].set_title("scaled log(y)")

# %% [markdown]
# ### Input Variable
#
# We'll now transform our input variable $\mathbf{X}$ to be distributed according to a
# unit Gaussian.

# %%
x_scaler = StandardScaler().fit(Xtr)
scaled_Xtr = x_scaler.transform(Xtr)
scaled_Xte = x_scaler.transform(Xte)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Model fitting
#
# With data now loaded and preprocessed, we'll proceed to defining a Gaussian process
# model and optimising its parameters. This notebook purposefully does not go into
# great detail on this process, so please see notebooks such as the
# [Regression notebook](https://docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com/examples/regression/)
# and
# [Classification notebook](https://docs.jaxgaussianprocesses.com/examples/classification)
# for further information.
#
# ### Model specification
#
# We'll use a radial basis function kernel to parameterise the Gaussian process in this
# notebook. As we have 5 covariates, we'll assign each covariate its own lengthscale
# parameter. This form of kernel is commonly known as an automatic relevance
# determination (ARD) kernel.
#
# In practice, the exact form of kernel used should be selected such that it
# represents your understanding of the data. For example, if you were to model
# temperature; a process that we know to be periodic, then you would likely wish to
# select a periodic kernel. Having _Gaussian-ised_ our data somewhat, we'll also adopt
# a Gaussian likelihood function.

# %%
n_train, n_covariates = scaled_Xtr.shape
kernel = gpx.RBF(active_dims=list(range(n_covariates)))
meanf = gpx.mean_functions.Zero()
prior = gpx.Prior(mean_function=meanf, kernel=kernel)

likelihood = gpx.Gaussian(num_datapoints=n_train)

posterior = prior * likelihood

# %% [markdown]
# ### Model Optimisation
#
# With a model now defined, we can proceed to optimise the hyperparameters of our
# model using Optax.

# %%
training_data = gpx.Dataset(X=scaled_Xtr, y=scaled_ytr)

negative_mll = jit(gpx.ConjugateMLL(negative=True))
optimiser = ox.adamw(0.05)

opt_posterior, history = gpx.fit(
    model=posterior,
    objective=negative_mll,
    train_data=training_data,
    optim=ox.adamw(learning_rate=0.05),
    num_iters=500,
    key=key,
)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Prediction
#
# With an optimal set of parameters learned, we can make predictions on the set of
# data that we held back right at the start. We'll do this in the usual way by first
# computing the latent function's distribution before computing the predictive
# posterior distribution.

# %%
latent_dist = opt_posterior(scaled_Xte, training_data)
predictive_dist = likelihood(latent_dist)

predictive_mean = predictive_dist.mean()
predictive_stddev = predictive_dist.stddev()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Evaluation
#
# We'll now show how the performance of our Gaussian process can be evaluated by
# numerically and visually.
#
# ### Metrics
#
# To numerically assess the performance of our model, two commonly used metrics are
# root mean squared error (RMSE) and the R2 coefficient. RMSE is simply the square
# root of the squared difference between predictions and actuals. A value of 0 for
# this metric implies that our model has 0 generalisation error on the test set. R2
# measures the amount of variation within the data that is explained by the model.
# This can be useful when designing variance reduction methods such as control
# variates as it allows you to understand what proportion of the data's variance will
# be soaked up. A perfect model here would score 1 for R2 score, whereas predicting
# the data's mean would score 0 and models doing worse than simple mean predictions
# can score less than 0.

# %%
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_true=scaled_yte.squeeze(), y_pred=predictive_mean)
r2 = r2_score(y_true=scaled_yte.squeeze(), y_pred=predictive_mean)
print(f"Results:\n\tRMSE: {rmse: .4f}\n\tR2: {r2: .2f}")

# %% [markdown]
# Both of these metrics seem very promising, so, based off these, we can be quite
# happy that our first attempt at modelling the Yacht data is promising.
#
# ### Diagnostic plots
#
# To accompany the above metrics, we can also produce residual plots to explore
# exactly where our model's shortcomings lie. If we define a residual as the true
# value minus the prediction, then we can produce three plots:
#
# 1. Predictions vs. actuals.
# 2. Predictions vs. residuals.
# 3. Residual density.
#
# The first plot allows us to explore if our model struggles to predict well for
# larger or smaller values by observing where the model deviates more from the line
# $y=x$. In the second plot we can inspect whether or not there were outliers or
# structure within the errors of our model. A well-performing model would have
# predictions close to and symmetrically distributed either side of $y=0$. Such a
# plot can be useful for diagnosing heteroscedasticity. Finally, by plotting a
# histogram of our residuals we can observe whether or not there is any skew to
# our residuals.

# %%
residuals = scaled_yte.squeeze() - predictive_mean

fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(9, 2.5), tight_layout=True)

ax[0].scatter(predictive_mean, scaled_yte.squeeze(), color=cols[1])
ax[0].plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color=cols[0], transform=ax[0].transAxes)
ax[0].set(xlabel="Predicted", ylabel="Actual", title="Predicted vs Actual")

ax[1].scatter(predictive_mean.squeeze(), residuals, color=cols[1])
ax[1].plot([0, 1], [0.5, 0.5], color=cols[0], transform=ax[1].transAxes)
ax[1].set_ylim([-1.0, 1.0])
ax[1].set(xlabel="Predicted", ylabel="Residuals", title="Predicted vs Residuals")

ax[2].hist(np.asarray(residuals), bins=30, color=cols[1])
ax[2].set_title("Residuals")

# %% [markdown]
# From this, we can see that our model is struggling to predict the smallest values
# of the Yacht's hydrodynamic and performs increasingly well as the Yacht's
# hydrodynamic performance increases. This is likely due to the original data's heavy
# right-skew, and successive modelling attempts may wish to introduce a
# heteroscedastic likelihood function that would enable more flexible modelling of
# the smaller response values.
