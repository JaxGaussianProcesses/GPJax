One example of this is the lengthscale parameter in any of the stationary kernels. It would not make sense to have a negative lengthscale, and as such the parameter's value is constrained to exist only on the positive real line. \n",

    "Whilst mathematically correct, constrained parameters can become a pain when optimising as many optimisers are designed to operate on an unconstrained space. Further, it can often be computationally inefficient to restrict the search space of an optimiser.

The optimisation is then done on this unconstrained parameter before we transform it back when we need to evaluate its value. \n",

Implicitly, by the very use of a Gaussian process, we are incorporating our prior information around the functional behaviour of the latent function that we are seeking to recover. However, we can take this one step further by placing priors on the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. Going into the details of which priors are recommended and how to go about selecting them goes beyond the scope of this article, but it suffices to say that doing so can greatly enhance the utility of a Gaussian process. \n",

As an example of this, consider the lengthscale parameter $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. When specifying a prior distribution $p_{0}(\\ell)$, I would typically select a distribution that has support on the positive real line, such as the Gamma distribution. An opposing approach would be to transform the parameter so that it is defined on the entire real line (as discussed in ยง1) and then specify a prior distribution such as a Gaussian that has unconstrained support. Deciding which of these two approaches to adopt in GPJax is somewhat a moot point to me, so I've opted for priors to be defined on the constrained parameter. That being said, I'd be more than open to altering this opinion is people felt strongly that priors should be defined on the unconstrained parameter value."

In mathematics and statistics, we are often presented with the task of solving a linear system of equations $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{y}$ for $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ and $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\\mathbf{y}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}$. In this scenario, our goal is to identify the values of $\\mathbf{x}$ and for people who studied numerical methods, this probably evokes flashbacks to manually calculating $\\mathbf{x}$ using Gaussian elimination. Whilst manageable for a handful of unknown variables, we certainly would not want to do Gaussian elimination for systems containing thousands of variables. Fortunately, computers are quite good at solving these types of problem.\n",
