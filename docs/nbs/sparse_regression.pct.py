# # Sparse Variational Inference
#
# In this notebook we demonstrate how to implement sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGPs) of <strong data-cite="hensman2013gaussian">Hensman et al. (2013)</strong>; <strong data-cite="hensman2015gaussian">Hensman et al. (2015)</strong>. In particular, this approximation framework provides a tractable option for working with non-conjugate Gaussian processes with more ~5000 data points. However, for conjugate models of less than 5000 data points, we recommend using the marginal log-likelihood approach presented in the [regression notebook](https://gpjax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbs/regression.html).

# ## Dataset
#
# With the necessary modules imported, we simulate a dataset $\mathcal{D} = (\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}) = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{5000}$ with inputs $\boldsymbol{x}$ sampled uniformly on $(-5, 5)$ and corresponding binary outputs
#
# $$\boldsymbol{y} \sim \mathcal{N} \left(\sin(4 * \boldsymbol{x}) + \sin(2 * \boldsymbol{x}), \textbf{I} * (0.2)^{2} \right).$$
#
# We store our data $\mathcal{D}$ as a GPJax `Dataset` and create test inputs for later.

# ## Sparse GPs via inducing inputs
#
# Despite their endowment with elegant theoretical properties, GPs are burdened with prohibitive $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ inference and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ memory costs in the number of data points $n$ due to the necessity of computing inverses and determinants of the kernel Gram matrix $\mathbf{K}_{\boldsymbol{x}\boldsymbol{x}}$ during inference and hyperparameter learning. 
# Sparse GPs seek to resolve tractability through low-rank approximations. 
# 
# Their name originates with the idea of using subsets of the data to approximate the kernel matrix, with _sparseness_ occurring through the selection of the data points. 
# Given inputs $\boldsymbol{x}$ and outputs $\boldsymbol{y}$ the task was to select an $m<n$ lower-dimensional dataset $(\boldsymbol{z},\boldsymbol{\tilde{y}}) \subset (\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y})$ to train a Gaussian process on instead. 
# By generalising the set of selected points $\boldsymbol{z}$, known as _inducing inputs_, to remove the restriction of being part of the dataset, 
# we can arrive at a flexible low-rank approximation framework of the model using functions of $\mathbf{K}_{\boldsymbol{z}\boldsymbol{z}}$ to replace the true covariance matrix $\mathbf{K}_{\boldsymbol{x}\boldsymbol{x}}$ at significantly lower costs. For example, <strong data-cite="quinonero-candela2005gaussian"></strong> review many popular approximation schemes in this vein. However, because the model and the approximation are intertwined, assigning performance and faults to one or the other becomes tricky. 
# 
# On the other hand, sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGPs) [approximate the posterior, not the model](https://www.secondmind.ai/labs/sparse-gps-approximate-the-posterior-not-the-model/). 
# These provide a low-rank approximation scheme via variational inference. Here we posit a family of densities parameterised by “variational parameters”. 
# We then seek to find the closest family member to the posterior by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence over the variational parameters. 
# The fitted variational density then serves as a proxy for the exact posterior. 
# This procedure makes variational methods efficiently solvable via off-the-shelf optimisation techniques whilst retaining the true-underlying model. 
# Furthermore, SVGPs offer further cost reductions with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent  <strong data-cite="hensman2013gaussian"></strong> and address non-conjugacy <strong data-cite="hensman2015gaussian"></strong>. 
# We show a cost comparison between the approaches below, where $b$ is the mini-batch size.
#

# |    | GPs | sparse GPs | SVGP |
# | -- | -- | -- | -- | 
# | Inference cost | $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ | $\mathcal{O}(n m^2)$ | $\mathcal{O}(b m^2)$  | 
# | Memory cost    | $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ | $\mathcal{O}(n m)$ | $\mathcal{O}(b m)$ |


# To apply SVGP inference to our dataset, we begin by initialising $m = 50$ eqaully spaced inducing inputs $\boldsymbol{z}$ across our observed data's support. These are depicted below via horizontal black lines.

# The inducing inputs will summarise our dataset, and since they are treated as variaitonal parameters, their locations will be optimised. The next step to SVGP is to define a variational family.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Defining the variational process
#
# We begin by considering the form of the posterior distribution for all function values $f(\cdot)$
#
# \begin{align} 
# p(f(\cdot) | \mathcal{D}) = \int p(f(\cdot)|f(\boldsymbol{x})) p(f(\boldsymbol{x})|\mathcal{D}) \text{d}f(\boldsymbol{x}). \qquad (\dagger) 
# \end{align}
#
# To arrive at an approximation framework, we assume some redundacy in the data. Instead of predicting $f(\cdot)$ with function values at the datapoints $f(\boldsymbol{x})$, we assume this can be achieved with only function values at $m$ inducing inputs $\boldsymbol{z}$
#
# $$ p(f(\cdot) | \mathcal{D}) \approx \int p(f(\cdot)|f(\boldsymbol{z})) p(f(\boldsymbol{z})|\mathcal{D}) \text{d}f(\boldsymbol{z}). \qquad (\star) $$
#
# This lower dimensional integral results in computational savings in the model's predictive component from $p(f(\cdot)|f(\boldsymbol{x}))$ to $p(f(\cdot)|f(\boldsymbol{z}))$ where inverting $\mathbf{K}_{\boldsymbol{x}\boldsymbol{x}}$ is replaced with inverting $\mathbf{K}_{\boldsymbol{z}\boldsymbol{z}}$. 
# However, since we did not observe our data $\mathcal{D}$ at $\boldsymbol{z}$ we ask, what exactly is the posterior $p(f(\boldsymbol{z})|\mathcal{D})$?
#
# Notice this is simply obtained by substituting $\boldsymbol{z}$ into $(\dagger)$, but we arrive back at square one with computing the expensive integral. To side-step this, we consider replacing $p(f(\boldsymbol{z})|\mathcal{D})$ in $(\star)$ with a cheap-to-compute approximate distribution $q(f(\boldsymbol{z}))$
# 
#   $$ q(f(\cdot)) = \int p(f(\cdot)|f(\boldsymbol{z})) q(f(\boldsymbol{z})) \text{d}f(\boldsymbol{z}).$$
# 
# To measure the quality of the approximation, we consider the Kullback-Leibler divergence $\operatorname{KL}(\cdot || \cdot)$ from our approximate process $q(f(\cdot))$ to the true process $p(f(\cdot)|\mathcal{D})$. By parametrising $q(f(\boldsymbol{z}))$ over a variational family of distributions, we can optimise Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the variational parameters. Moreover, since inducing input locations $\boldsymbol{z}$ augment the model, they themselves can be treated as variational parameters without altering the true underlying model $p(f(\boldsymbol{z})|\mathcal{D})$. This is exactly what gives SVGPs great flexibility whilst retaining robustness to overfitting. 
# 
# It is popular to elect a Gaussian variational family $q(f(\boldsymbol{z})) = \mathcal{N}(f(\boldsymbol{z}); \mathbf{m}, \mathbf{S})$ with parameters $\{\boldsymbol{z}, \mathbf{m}, \mathbf{S}\}$, since conjugacy is provided between $q(f(\boldsymbol{z}))$ and $p(f(\cdot)|f(\boldsymbol{z}))$ so that the resulting variational process $q(f(\cdot))$ is a GP. We can impliment this in GPJax by the following.
# %%
likelihood = gpx.Gaussian(num_datapoints=n)
p = gpx.Prior(kernel=gpx.RBF()) * likelihood
q = gpx.VariationalGaussian(inducing_inputs=z)
# %% [markdown]
# 
# We combine our true and approximate posterior Gaussian processes into an `SVGP` object to define the variational strategy that we will adopt in the forthcoming inference.

# %%
svgp = gpx.SVGP(posterior=p, variational_family=q)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inference
#
# ### Evidence lower bound
#
# With our model defined, we seek to infer the optimal the inducing inputs $\boldsymbol{z}$, variational mean $\mathbf{m}$ and covariance $\mathbf{S}$ that define our approximate posterior. To achieve this, we maximise the evidence lower bound (ELBO) with respect to $\{\boldsymbol{z}, \mathbf{m}, \mathbf{S} \}$, a proxy for minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Moreover, as hinted by its name, the ELBO is a lower bound to the marginal log-likelihood, providing a tractable objective to optimise the model's hyperparameters akin to the conjugate setting. For further details on this, see Sections 3.1 and 4.1 of the excellent review paper <strong data-cite="leibfried2020tutorial"></strong>.
#
# Since Optax's optimisers work to minimise functions, to maximise the ELBO we return its negative.

params = gpx.transform(params, unconstrainers)

loss_fn = jit(svgp.elbo(D, constrainers, negative=True))

# %% [markdown]
# ### Mini-batching
#
# Despite introducing inducing inputs into our model, inference can still be intractable with large datasets. To circumvent this, optimisation can be done using stochastic mini-batches. The `Dataset` object given in GPJax can easily be batched using the `batch()` method. Further accelerations can be given using prefetching and caching in a manner similar to [TensorFlow's Dataset object](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance).
